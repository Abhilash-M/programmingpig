This directory contains Pig Latin scripts and code for UDFs used to prepare the
data for these examples.  

The tomap UDF, used to convert batting statistics into a map, can be compiled
by doing:

javac -cp <path>/pig.jar tomap.java

where <path> is the path to a copy of pig.jar.  It can then be placed in the
jar by doing 

jar -cf udf.jar tomap.class 

Once you have downloaded the baseball data (see ../data/README for information
on obtaining the data) you can run

<path>/bin/pig -x local baseball.pig
